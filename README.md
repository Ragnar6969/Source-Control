# Source-Control

The source code I added changed my perspective of IT, because it taught me how to use multiple forms in C#, 
thus made my coding experience much easier. 

The problem solving technique I used was trial and error. I created different types of variables and see which I could read through multiple forms.
I ended up with public static variables and used a get method from visual studio to read the data across the multiple forms.
